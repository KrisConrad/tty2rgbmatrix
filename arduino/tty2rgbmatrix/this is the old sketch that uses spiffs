this is the original sketch that only uses spiffs. 
i'm not going to continue working on this one since 
there's no space left on the microcontroller. 
its being left here for historical purposes. 

if you wanna build a tty2rbgmatix you need to look 
in the tty2rgbmatrix_sd folder for the good stuff.
