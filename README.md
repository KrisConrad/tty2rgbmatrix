# tty2rgbmatrix
MiSTer fpga add-on showing text, pictures or animated gifs on an RGB matrix panel powered by an ESP32

this project is adapted from https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled project to show mister core information on a separate display. i had an RGB matrix panel from another project lying around and figured i'd see what i could do.
